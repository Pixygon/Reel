## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-27

### Added
- Reel now plays video through libmpv when it's installed, unlocking hardware-accelerated decode, correct colour conversion, audio playback with real audio/video sync, subtitle support, and frame-exact seeking. The status bar shows which backend (mpv or ffmpeg) is active.

### Changed
- If libmpv isn't available, Reel automatically falls back to the original ffmpeg-subprocess decoder (video only, keyframe-accurate seek), so playback still works everywhere. You can force this fallback with the REEL_BACKEND=ffmpeg environment variable.
- Opening a video file now starts playback immediately instead of loading it paused.

### Improved
- Playing a video to the end and pressing play again now replays it from the start, VLC-style, instead of staying stuck at the end.
- Redraws are now paced more precisely, keeping the UI responsive during playback and briefly after opening or seeking a file, without spinning the CPU when idle.
